### What I learned

- **Light dark theme with React and Sass**: 
  Through this project, I was able to learn about how to implement a light and dark theme using react and sass.

- **React Routing**:
  My first time working routes in react. I learnt and understood more about how client-side routing works, along with the different ways to route between pages in react.

- **Infinite Scrolling using React**:
  I also learnt how to implement infinite scrolling feature in a react app.

- **Live search and filter**:
  The project's requirement for a search and filter feature provided the perfect opportunity for me to learn how to implement a live search and filter feature in a react app.
